# injection-sim


This repository contains code and data necessary to run numerical simulations of gas injections into hydrate-bearing sediment. This work is currently in review for publication at Water Resources Research under the manuscript title "Nitrogen-driven chromatographic separation during gas injection into hydrate-bearing sediments". Additional information will follow pertaining to citation instructions if that paper is accepted for publication. As of now, a second simulator built in Python is under development and will be linked from this page. That simulator will supersede this one.

To begin a simulation, edit and run "mixedhydrate_flowmodel.m". This file contains the simulation specific information (i.e., boundary condtions, grid points, save name, etc.)
